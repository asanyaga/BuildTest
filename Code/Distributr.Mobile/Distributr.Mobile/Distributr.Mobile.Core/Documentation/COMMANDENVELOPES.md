=================

This section covers envelopes and the commands that they contain. It shows which commands are sent for each of the currently support scenarios and also includes mapping details for common fields. You can find some examples envelopes which were extracted from the Distributr Java app v3_0_0 [here] (https://github.com/nutshellit/VirtualCity-Distributr/tree/master/Distributr.Mobile/Distributr.Mobile.Core.Test/Data/Distributr_v3_0_0)
